# My-firs-cpp-project---Movie-ticket-booking-system
This is my first c++ project for my university task. I made a nice simple movie ticket booking program. This one is without GUI.

The program allows the user to input his/her full name and username. This will lead to main menu. There are options to view schedules, timings,
book tickets, view user ticket information and access logged in user information.

The program reads the schedules of the movies from a .txt file that has been made beforehand.

Im using simple commands with while, for loops. Also different if, elseif,else statements. I implemented different functions for the main menu as well to give the code a better look. There is some file reading and writing and user input checks.



I would be defenitely able to add features and make the code better/cleaner, but I need to work on my university`s other projects as well atm. I would add some classes, for example, ticket/movie.
