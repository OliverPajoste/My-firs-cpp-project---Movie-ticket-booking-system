# My-firs-cpp-project---Movie-ticket-booking-system
This is my first c++ project for my university task. I made a nice simple movie ticket booking program. This one is without GUI.

The program allows the user to input his/her full name and username. This will lead to main menu. There are options to view schedules, timings,
book tickets, view user ticket information and access logged in user information.

The program reads the schedules of the movies from a .txt file that has been made beforehand.

I would be defenitely able to add features and make the code better/cleaner, but I need to work on my university`s other projects as well atm.
